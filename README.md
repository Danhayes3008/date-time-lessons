# Simple Clock And Countdown Clock Project

This project is a simple clock and countdown timer project. It was designed to help me get a better understanding on how these functions work.

## next steps

the next steps will be learning to manipulate the clock and countdown.
for the countdown i will attempt to have it start the countdown when a button is pressed, this will be a simple form to allow the user to set the coutdown timer too.

These functions will also be incorporated into other projects at later date as required.
